# NARD2_GWAS
NARD2 is the second version of the Northeast Asian Reference Database (NARD), an imputation panel. With NARD2, more accurate imputation and very rare variants can be obtained. We used this to imputation of Korean K chip data from 73,000 people, and using this, we performed GWAS for various phenotypes (BMI, height, glucose, T2DM, HbA1c, HTN, etc.). As a result, we could know the effect on the phenotype of the very rare variant, which could not be known without imputation. Finally, scRNA-seq data and snATAC-seq data are used to construct a framework that can be interpreted biologically on how rare variants affect phenotypes!
